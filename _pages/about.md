Hello!

I am a final-year Ph.D. Candidate in Natural Language Processing group at The Ohio State University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Huan Sun](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/). Previously, I did my internship at IBM Research in 2022 and Adobe in 2024. Prior to OSU, I received B.S. in CSE from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and was a research intern in UCLA, working with Prof. [Fabien Scalzo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9Z1pfWMAAAAJ&hl=en).

My primary research lies in the area of natural language processing and machine learning. Specifically:

- **Large Language Models and Agents**: post-training, evaluation, analysis, data engineering, and LLM-based agent framework design.
- **Natural Language Interface**: building advanced natural language interfaces to tables and relational databases (a.k.a. semantic parsing, table QAs).
- **Learning Paradigm**: instruction tuning and federated learning.


*I'm actively looking for collaborators. Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in working with me!*
